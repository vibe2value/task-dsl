# task-dsl

> A constrained AI task decomposition engine built around a user-customisable DSL.

This repository is a living reference implementation that evolves alongside the writing on https://vibe2value.com.

The goal is simple:

Translate intent → into structured, validated tasks → safely.

The DSL defines the boundaries.
The AI reasons within them.

Built on:
- Cloudflare Workers
- Hono
- D1
- Zod
- pnpm
- React + chadcn/ui

Expect:
- Iterative DSL design
- Prompt engineering patterns
- Validation guardrails
- Versioning decisions
- Production trade-offs

This is not a product.
  
It is a place to watch as the 3×3×3 framework (Shape → Build → Launch) unfolds in code.
